# Challenge
A plugin that is extremely hard to beat!
To install the plugin drag "challenge.jar" to the "plugins" folder in the server and then reload your server!
This is my first public plugin so yeah... If there are any mistakes/glitches then i'm sorry :(

I changed these:

Note: Play on normal mode, reload the server then kill all mobs and then play! only blazes ,endermen , silverfish and passive mobs will despawn and you will never get armour from mobs!
(also put all the gamerules to their default setting! so gamerule doInsomnia to true and stuff!)

Other notes:

When you mine a block the item you used has a 3% chance for it to break! (if you hit a mob it is 2% chance and same for bows)

if you mine dirt/grass you have a 5% chance to get tetanus (wither II for 10 seconds)

if you catch on fire in the nether it will never go out, + it deals double damage (lava does * 1.5 damage!)

When you go through a nether portal two ghasts will spawn (this might not work if the portal spawns in a cave/ravine)
and when you come back, 1 ghast spawns!

you can only cook iron in a blast furnace, and you can only cook food in a smoker!
